                    The concept for our logo is derived from the shape of human hands, the shape they make when held with the palms facing each other.<br />
<br />
Usually, when we hold an object in our palms, it is something we care about, something valuable to us. Like when a blow of air attempts to put off a candle that gives us light, we protect it with our palms. When a tiny bird falls from its nest, we hold it up and protect it in our palms. When a sculptor sculpts a masterpiece, he shapes it using his fingers and palms. Hence, our logo depicts the amount of care and emotion we put into each and every creation.<br />
<br />
Moreover, it is a symbol that inspires us on a daily basis to be caring towards our clients and protect their interests by providing an uncompromising level of service and superior products.</div>
