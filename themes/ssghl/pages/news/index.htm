                    <br />
                    As Dhaka moves forward into the new decade as one of the fastest-growing capitals in the world, it warrants an efficient and competent corporate infrastructure. Multinational companies and rising startups with local and foreign funding need office spaces to operate their businesses. Therefore, the need for space with proper amenities has been rising for a long time now. Shanta Holdings has addressed the demand and approached it with a plan to build world-class office spaces. Shanta Holdings Ltd has set the benchmark for Bangladesh&rsquo;s modern living and commercial spaces. Let us look at some projects that are going to set Shanta Holdings Ltd apart in Bangladesh&rsquo;s real estate market.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    <strong>The Sanctum</strong><br />
                    The Sanctum is going to be one of the finest apartment buildings of Shanta till date. The amenities offered are geared to exceed the expectations of modern-day residents. Situated in the most serene and calmest part of Gulshan-road 81, the 20 apartments of The Sanctum are 3,950 sq. ft. approximately.

The 14th-floor rooftop aims to provide a panoramic view of northern Gulshan, complemented with a BBQ zone and a beautifully landscaped deck. Its triple-height entry aims to provide a grand and majestic reception for all. A fine touch of sophisticated interior design complemented with modern amenities will make The Sanctum a marvelous abode. The Sanctum will have a gym equipped with all the modern-day state-of-the-art equipment sourced from the USA to provide residents with a chance to focus on physical well-being. The overall design, lighting, it&rsquo;s own in-ceiling sound system, create the perfect environment for an ideal gym crafted as an amenity to the residents. Lastly but definitely not the least, the 40-feet long heated swimming pool will be one to truly relish, allowing residents to dive into the blue and stargaze across the beautiful skyline.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    <strong>Aura</strong><br />
                    One of the most premium and exquisite residential developments of Shanta Housing Ltd, Aura, will be a symbol of pure class and sophistication in the city. Located at road 83 of Gulshan North, Aura is being built on a spacious 35 kathas of land and will have 14 floors. The most unique feature of Aura is its location &ndash; located directly beside Justice Shahabuddin Park, residents will be able to enjoy a stunning lifetime view of the most beautiful park in the city. The 52-feet long front road provides ample space for vehicle movement without obstruction and at the same time enhances the approach to the building. Aura will have 45 apartment units ranging from 3,350 sq. ft. to 7,100 sq. ft. Each unit will be able to enjoy the uninterrupted and unparalleled park views, a rare opportunity in the city.<br />
                    The exterior design of Aura is a marvel by itself. The minimalism of the architecture coupled with utmost functionality for the end user, such as through the use of floor to ceiling windows to maximize views, makes it a prime example of modern-day residential architecture. Aura will house a fully equipped state-of-the-art gym and boast a 40-feet long heated infinity pool on the roof, allowing residents to achieve full relaxation of both mind and body. A stylish party room, well-appointed with trendy fittings and furniture, will allow residents to host the most elegant large-group parties within the bounds of their homes.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Eyrie</strong><br />
                    The Eyrie &ndash; located in the vibrant zone of Gulshan-road 50 ensures the efficiency and comfort of modern living wrapped in elegance. A space that makes memories more vivid and more meaningful, Eyrie offers 4,550 sq. ft. of single unit apartments that will ensure the residents&rsquo; exclusivity and comfort of living in serenity.

The soothing greeneries of the surroundings will give a sense of tranquility in the midst of the urban jungle. Shanta is well known in the market for the quality and level of detailing that goes into the common area planning and interior design, and Eyrie is going to be another excellent example of that very standard. The waiting lounge beside the elegant reception will give a fine first impression for the visitors. The windows will be made of double-glazed glass that resists urban noise from entering. The fittings and fixtures will be of true international standard. Eyrie also comes with a multi-level basement car parking with a mechanical ventilation system. The beauty of Eyrie also includes a rooftop party space for the dwellers to have a get-together or host outdoor parties at their desire.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Pinnacle</strong><br />
                    Commercial space is of high demand in our fast developing city due to the rapid economic growth. Catering to that need, Shanta Holdings Ltd. is developing Pinnacle, an iconic 40-storied commercial tower at Tejgaon &ndash; Gulshan Link road. Pinnacle is going to be built over 45 Kathas and will be the first 40 storied skyscraper in the country. It therefore stands at the precipice of creating a milestone in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure history, and with it, Dhaka joins the race to touch the sky, alongside the other milestone developments in our road to becoming a developed nation. True to its mantra of continuous innovation, Shanta aims to construct this marvel as the first wind tunnel tested structure in the country. The 40 storied tower will comprise office spaces ranging from 4,050 sq. ft. to 14,560 sq. ft., with unparalleled views of Hatirjheel. There will be five basement levels with a combined parking facility for 367 cars. The elegantly designed atrium entrance will be 45 feet high, thereby setting an unprecedented standard of commercial space architecture not seen previously in the local market. An aesthetically designed and spacious Caf&eacute; on the ground floor is aimed at providing space for recharging and socializing in between regular office hours. Moreover, the rooftop will house an awe-inspiring restaurant with a double height interior and the ultimate panoramic views of the city. An 11.5 feet clear spacing of the office floors will enable sophisticated, functional and modern office fit outs that contemporary workplaces demand. Leading tenants to these office spaces will be seven international brand high-speed elevators. Moreover, a separate service cum fireman&rsquo;s elevator, will enable smooth back of house operations like maintenance, cleaning and moving without any interruption to tenants. Insulated double-glazed, low-e, heat resistant glass in a fully unitized curtain wall system for energy efficiency, durability, dust and waterproofing is another unique feature aimed at making the working experience more comfortable. This is another aspect in which Shanta has set a new standard, having applied fully unitized curtain wall systems to it&rsquo;s preceding commercial projects Skymark and Forum also.<br />
                     With a no-compromise approach to safety, Pinnacle will be equipped with state-of-the-art firefighting and detection systems, complemented with structural and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) designs by world-renowned Meinhardt Group. Two Pressurized Fire Stairs with UL certified 02-hour fire resistant doors will provide maximum safety in case of any fire breakout. State-of-the art Integrated Building Automation System (IBMS) will allow complete 24/7 building monitoring and safety, empowering efficient facility management. Moreover, Shanta is going to pursue LEED certification to attest to the green, sustainable and energy-efficient design and state-of-the-art specifications that are going into Pinnacle to make it a truly international-standard development.<br />
                      The First of its kind in our country, Pinnacle will surely redefine the skyline. Not only will it upgrade the architectural landscape, but is destined to enhance the overall corporate office environment and experience in the country, and set a new benchmark once it opens its stately doors.</p>
